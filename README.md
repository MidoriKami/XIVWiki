# XIV Wiki
Extremely simple plugin, only adds a single command **/wiki**
  
### Why is this useful?
If you are in a instance, and the boss or a monster does something unexpected, and you want to know what the mechanics are, you can simply **/wiki [instancename]** and it will pull up the wiki article in a web browser.
