# XIV Wiki
Extremely simple plugin, only adds a single command **/wiki** which allows you to quickly open wikipages from linked items or ingame context 

### WIP - Upcoming Features

Several amazing suggestions have been presented by the community!
This will allow the XIV Wiki to be quite awesome!

* Search for items via ingame link **<item>**
* Search using auto-translate text
* Display a Textbox onscreen to search
  * Display auto-complete text for things with similar names
* ~~Integrate with Browser Host to open **/wiki** searches ingame~~
  * Browser Host does not provide a sufficient experience to be used smoothly with XIVWiki
