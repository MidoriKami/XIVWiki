# XIV Wiki
Extremely simple plugin, only adds a single command **/wiki**
  
### Why is this useful?
If you are in a instance, and the boss or a monster does something unexpected, and you want to know what the mechanics are, you can simply **/wiki [instancename]** and it will pull up the wiki article in a web browser.

### This tool only includes Dungeons, Raids, and Trials
This tool works by referencing pre-generated json files generated with my [XIV Parsing Tool](https://github.com/MidoriKami/XIVWikiParser).
If you would like to reach out and help me develop a better method for lookup please dont hesitate to post an issue.
